    <img src = "images/pizza.webp">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 cups warm water (110 degrees F)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1/5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Prep the Pizza Dough</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour warm water into a large bowl. Stir in sugar to dissolve and sprinkle yeast on top and let stand until foamy for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir olive oil and salt into yeast mixture. Mix in whole wheat flour and 1 cup flour until dough comes together. Knead dough until it absorbs all the flour and is smooth. Place dough in oiled bowl and turn to coat the surface. Cover loosely with towel and let stand in a warm place until it doubles in size. Could take about 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Coat the outside of the dough in light flour and form into a ball. Place it back into an oiled bowl and coat the surface. Let stand in a warm place for about 45 minutes so it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Grease a large pizza pan. Roll the dough in with a rolling pin until it won't stretch anymore. Use your hands to form the crusts, giving it some thickness. When ready place in pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Coat the pizza with the marinara sauce, cheese, and toppings.</li>
        <li>Preheat the over to 425 degrees F. Bake the pizza for about 15-20 minutes or until the crusts are crisp and brown. Let Cool for 5 minutes before enjoying with the family!</li>
